# 05_third_party_apis

On this week's Read Me!!!! Third Party API's. The Homework this week wasnt too bad. A nice break from last week where we had to make the quiz.

Boiler Plate CSS and HTML was given to us, But I contributed the following.

- Used boostrap for formatting the time blocks.

- Used moment.js libray for the current time. I converted the current time to military time and labeled each time block accordingly. If the current time (hour) was equal to the Id number of the input field I used Jquery DOM maniuplation to add a "class" that ties to the CSS that was provided.

- Used local storage to store the user data and utlized a jquery event listner to save the data when the users preses the "font-awesome" save button.

- To add a little personality I added some differnt coloring. I found a Hexcode color pallette online and used some of those to make it unique.

- Utilized a media query in CSS to format the page better for smaller screens. I plan on tweaking this a bit more, so if I make any big changes I will update my readme.

# Things I am still struggling with

I orginally wanted to make this document with very little amound of HTML. I wanted to utilize Jquery/Javascript DOM manipulation to dynamically create all the time blocks. I was struglling with the nesting of the DIV's and appending the data. I spoke with the TA and he lead me to the path to hard code the html. I be fair this was a big relief and allowed me to focus on the Jquery elements and local storage. I plan to use the free time I got back studying server side API's and DOM manipulation. Also Storage is a bit tricky espcially when you have to get JSON involved.

Also wanted to say thank you for reading/grading. I imagine looking at all these websites and reading these ReadMe's prolly isnt the funnest thing in the world, but hey I really appreciate the feedback.
